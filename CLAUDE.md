# CLAUDE.md

## What this is

A personal, single-user news aggregator for Connor (GitHub: couetilc), served at
https://news.cuteteal.com on Cloudflare Workers. Currently a hello-world Astro
skeleton; every change should move it toward being a useful news aggregator.

## Stack and architectural decisions

- **Astro 6 with `output: 'server'`** — all pages SSR by default (an aggregator
  serves fresh content). Opt individual pages back into prerendering with
  `export const prerender = true`.
- **`@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter v13**, built on `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`:
  `astro dev` runs the app **inside workerd** locally with real local bindings —
  this is the rapid-iteration loop. `astro build` emits the worker to
  `dist/server/` plus a deployable config at `dist/server/wrangler.json`;
  running `wrangler deploy` from the repo root auto-resolves that emitted config.
- **`imageService: 'compile'`** — build-time image optimization only, no
  Cloudflare Images billing dependency. Switch to `'cloudflare-binding'` if we
  ever transform external article images at runtime.
- **Sessions**: the adapter auto-configures Astro Sessions on a KV namespace
  bound as `SESSION`, auto-provisioned at first deploy.
- **`wrangler.jsonc` is the single infra config**: `account_id`, the custom
  domain route `news.cuteteal.com` (DNS record + certificate are auto-managed by
  Cloudflare), `nodejs_compat`. Declare future D1/R2/KV resources here — and
  update the token-scope comments in `.env.example` in the same commit.
- **node 24 via mise** (`mise.toml`); mise also injects `.env` into every shell
  run inside the project (`[env] _.file = ".env"`).
- **npm** for dependencies; `package-lock.json` is committed.
- Scaffold note: create-cloudflare (C3) crashed scaffolding Astro 6
  non-interactively (June 2026), so this was scaffolded with `create-astro` +
  `npx astro add cloudflare` — same end state.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server on workerd at http://localhost:4321
- `npm test` — vitest; **enforces 100% line and branch coverage over `src/**`**
  (the suite fails below that — this is the standing test policy)
- `npm run build` — build worker + assets into `dist/`
- `npm run preview` — serve the built worker locally in workerd
- `npm run deploy` — `astro build && wrangler deploy`
- `npm run cf-typegen` — regenerate `worker-configuration.d.ts` after any
  `wrangler.jsonc` change (commit the result)
- `npx wrangler tail` — stream production logs
- `npx wrangler secret put <KEY>` — set a production runtime secret
- `npx cf` — Cloudflare's unified CLI (technical preview) for inspecting
  production resources; inside `npx wrangler dev`, press `e` for the Local
  Explorer to browse local KV/D1/R2 state

## Credentials and secrets contract

- **`.env`** (gitignored) holds *tooling* credentials: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
  (wrangler reads `.env` natively) and `GH_TOKEN` (injected via mise for gh).
  **`.env.example` is the living documentation** for each token — purpose,
  regeneration steps, and exact scopes. Convention: any change to a token's
  required scope updates those comments in the same commit.
- **Worker runtime secrets** never go in `.env`: use `.dev.vars` locally and
  `npx wrangler secret put` for production.
- On Connor's machine, `npx wrangler login` (OAuth) and gh keyring auth also
  work. Cloud-agent sessions (Claude Code web / Dispatch) must have
  `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `GH_TOKEN` set as session environment secrets.

## Testing policy

`npm test` must pass before any commit. `vitest.config.ts` deliberately does
NOT load `astro.config.mjs` (`configFile: false`) because the Cloudflare Vite
plugin is incompatible with vitest's node environment; components are rendered
in tests via the Container API (`astro/container`). If worker-runtime-specific
logic appears (bindings, Durable Objects), adopt `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`
for those tests.

## Deploy flow

`npm run deploy`. The first deploy attaches the custom domain
`news.cuteteal.com` automatically (DNS + cert created by Cloudflare; cert
issuance can take a minute or two) and auto-provisions the `SESSION` KV
namespace. The worker is also reachable at its `*.workers.dev` URL (left
enabled). Verify with `curl -s https://news.cuteteal.com`.
